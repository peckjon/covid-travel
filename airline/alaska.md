#### Travel to/from Seattle (SEA)

As major construction continues at SeaTac airport, there may be delays during peak travel hours. Travel may also be affected by a series of updates to improve your future airport trips, including:

-   The continued expansion, renovation, and modernization of the North Satellite terminal, with fewer escalators operating between the train level and the North Satellite Concourse
-   Limited food and shopping options in some areas as merchants are upgraded
-   Flights operating out of remote gates via the newly opened D Concourse Annex, meaning some guests will travel on a shuttle bus to and from their aircraft
-   Closure of the Concourse C train station to replace temporary finishes

Be sure to arrive at least 2 hours before your flight departs to give yourself plenty of time to navigate these ongoing airport changes, and pay close attention to airport signs added to guide you during construction.

With this move, you'll find our ticket counters, kiosks, gates, curbside check-in, and baggage office at their new locations in the new terminal. Keep an eye out for airport signs added to guide you, and see our [New Orleans airport page](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/airports/louisiana/new-orleans/louis-armstrong-international) for detailed airport information.

#### Travel to/from San Francisco (SFO)

Gate numbers are being updated: San Francisco International Airport is in the process of simplifying the numbering of their gates. On October 16, 2019, the gates we use in Terminal 2 and the International Terminal will be renumbered. Our flights will still operate from the same gates; those gates will just be labeled with new numbers.

-   Our Terminal 2 gate numbers will be updated from 50A - 59C to D1 - D18.
-   Our International Terminal gate numbers will be updated from A1A - A12 to A1 - A15.

Be sure to check your flight details for updated gate number information in the email you'll receive before your trip, in [our mobile app,](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/mobile/mobile-apps) and on your boarding pass. We also recommend signing up to receive [flight notifications](https://www.alaskaair.com/flightnotifications) and watching your [flight status](https://www.alaskaair.com/flightstatus) to see the latest updates on your flight.

Note: Alaska Airlines is currently operating flights out of both Terminal 2 and the International Terminal. Most flights arrive and depart out of Terminal 2, but some may arrive at the International Terminal.

If your flight arrives at the International Terminal and your connecting flight leaves from a different terminal, you will need to leave security and take the [AirTrain This indicates a link to an external site that may not follow the same accessibility or privacy policies as Alaska Airlines. By selecting a partner link you agree to share your data with these sites.](https://www.flysfo.com/services-amenities/getting-around-sfo)(located just outside of the International Terminal security checkpoint) to get to your flight.

Give yourself plenty of time to get from one terminal to another. AirTrain rides between the International Terminal and Terminal 2 generally take 5-7 minutes, but be aware that travel time from the farthest International gate to the Alaska Airlines gates in Terminal 2 could take up to 35 minutes.
