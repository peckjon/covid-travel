## Waiving change & cancellation fees

Guided by our purpose of care, we are temporarily adjusting our policies to allow for maximum flexibility to help you make the right decisions regarding travel at this time:	
<br/><br/>

### Existing reservations for upcoming travel between March 14 and April 30, 2020:

All existing reservations made before March 13, 2020 that are for arrivals between March 14 and April 30, 2020 can be changed or cancelled at no charge up to 24 hours before your scheduled arrival. This includes Advance Purchase Rate reservations.

### New reservations for any future travel:

Any reservation you make between March 13, 2020 and April 30, 2020 – for any future arrival date – can be changed or cancelled at no charge up to 24 hours before your scheduled arrival. This includes Advance Purchase Rate reservations.

### Existing Advance Purchase Rate non-refundable reservations for travel through June 2020:

As announced earlier, special exceptions are in place for all Advance Purchase Rate non-refundable reservations made directly with Hyatt on or before March 8, 2020 for arrivals before June 30, 2020. Guests holding these fully prepaid reservations who have decided not to travel may still opt, at least 24 hours before their stay, to receive 10,000 World of Hyatt Bonus Points compensation in lieu of both their stay and the offer above (if eligible). World of Hyatt points may be used toward future travel at any of our 900+ hotels across 17 brands globally.	
<br/><br/>

For full details and to make arrangements, please call one of our Global Contact Centers or email us at worldofhyatt@hyatt.com.

Guests who booked via online travel agents or other third parties are advised to contact their booking provider for information on their policies and for assistance.

## Flexing the World of Hyatt loyalty program

We are closely listening to our World of Hyatt members and using their feedback to continually evaluate ways to flex the program. In the spirit of advancing care for members during these unique circumstances, we are making the following World of Hyatt program modifications:	
<br/><br/>

### Suspending Points Forfeiture:

We will be suspending the forfeiture of points through May 31, 2020. As a reminder, our general policy is that points do not expire, but they will be forfeited if a member’s account is inactive for 24 consecutive months.

### Postponing Award Chart Changes:

We are postponing the introduction of Off-Peak and Peak point redemption (originally planned for March 22, 2020) until 2021. This means that free-night redemptions will continue to be at standard rates for the rest of this year.

### Evaluating Elite Tier Qualification and Benefit Extension:

In February, World of Hyatt extended elite tier status and award expiration dates for qualifying members residing in Asia Pacific. Visit the World of Hyatt COVID-19 FAQs for details.

Given the quickly evolving nature of the situation, it is simply too early to suggest revised elite tier qualifications and award expiration beyond members in Asia Pacific. However, we know that adjustments will need to be made, and we are committed to communicating these as soon as we can.

On behalf of the entire Hyatt family, I want to reiterate that your safety and wellbeing remain our highest priority.

We thank you for your support and your loyalty and will continue to keep you updated through this dynamic situation.

My best,  
World of Hyatt
