### Change and Cancellation Fee Policies

Southwest Airlines never charges Customers a fee to change or cancel their flight. If a Customer's plans change, or they decide they no longer want to travel, the funds used to pay for their flight can be applied to future travel -- as long as they cancel their flight at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure. The funds are valid for future travel up to one year from the original purchase date and must be used by the individual named on the ticket. More information on policies related to travel funds can be found on Southwest.com. We hope these policies provide our Customers with flexibility and peace of mind as they plan their travel.
