Coronavirus Travel Updates
==========================

* * * * *

To help address customers with immediate travel needs, we are asking those who do not have travel in the next 72 hours to refrain from contacting us as we are experiencing high volume. Thank you for your patience and partnership as we work through this unprecedented situation.

If you are traveling soon and cannot get through on one of our service channels, rest assured, we will ensure all changes will be processed and applicable credits will be issued if you don't take your flight. Additional details will be updated soon.

We will continue to provide updates as the situation evolves. 

Waiver Information
------------------

* * * * *

For tickets where we are permitting a one-time change without a fee, the fare for your new flight will apply.  If the new fare is higher, we will collect the difference.  If the new fare is lower, we will issue a Delta travel voucher for the difference (very limited exceptions apply). 

If you are traveling to an impacted destination and a waiver applies (for example, designated countries in Asia, Europe and South or Central America), there is no price difference when you move your travel dates if you select travel that begins before December 31, 2020.
