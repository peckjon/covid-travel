Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates
------------------------------

### Health and safety

The safety of our customers and employees is and always will be our top priority. To learn more about the measures we're taking and how we're cleaning our planes, visit the [United Hub (content in English)](https://hub.united.com/united-coronavirus-covid19-safety-update-2645397564.html).

### Travel from Europe

In order to assist customers departing Europe, we have capped fares to the United States from countries affected by the government-imposed travel policy. If you're scheduled to travel March 10 -- April 30, 2020, and would like to change your plans, there is no fee to do so, regardless of when you purchased your ticket or where you're traveling. [See waiver details](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/notices.html#waiver6)

We will continue to fly our regular schedule from Europe to the U.S. through March 20, except Houston-London and Denver-London, which we're suspending after March 16. From March 20 through the end of April, we expect to fly three daily flights to London and have daily service to Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Paris and Zurich. We'll also maintain multiple flights to Frankfurt and Munich, along with four flights a week to Lisbon.

We will continue to follow the situation in Europe closely and make any changes necessary.

Additional travel flexibility

Booking a new flight: We know people are taking a second look at their travel plans right now, and we want you to have flexibility when planning your next trip --- that's why when you book a flight with us between March 3 and March 31, 2020, you can change it for free over the next 12 months. [See terms and conditions](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/notices.html#ChangeFeeTerms)

Rescheduling a trip: We're also waiving change fees for all tickets issued on or before March 2 --- domestic or international --- with original travel dates of March 9 through April 30. If you're not sure when you want to travel, you can cancel your trip and rebook later with change fees waived. [See waiver details](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/notices.html#waiver6)

How to change or cancel your flight: To change or cancel your flight online, [view your reservation](https://www.united.com/en/us/manageres/mytrips), enter your trip details and select the appropriate option.

Flight suspensions and schedule reductions

By Presidential Proclamation, the United States is currently denying entry to non-U.S. citizens who have visited or transited through the People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran or certain countries in Europe within the last 14 days, unless you are a lawful permanent resident. Travel-restricted countries include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Customers who are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents or immediate family members of U.S. citizens will be subject to additional health screenings on arrival to the United States. The CDC also advises that travelers returning from these countries in Europe must stay home for 14 days and monitor their health after returning to the U.S. Non-U.S. citizens who have visited the countries listed above in the past 14 days will not be allowed to enter the United States.

After evaluating our operations between the U.S. and Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong and Shanghai, we've decided to suspend those flights through April 30. We've also suspended ticket sales for MileagePlus Award travel and flights originating in China or Iran on our partner airlines through April 30.

We're taking additional steps to reduce our international and domestic schedules in ways that minimize the impact to our customers. We're also in close contact with the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) and other health organizations as we continue to evaluate the situation.
