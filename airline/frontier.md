### Questions About Our COVID19 Policy

***Updated March 17, 2020***

**I have a flight coming up, what is the latest time I can make changes?**

Changes must be made 24 hours prior to departure to receive a fee waiver for reservations that qualify for our flexible travel policy. Applicable fees will apply for any changes made within 24 hours of departure. http://bit.ly/Flexible-Travel

**If you're waiving change fees, why is it costing me more to change my flight?**

We are waiving change fees for reservations that qualify for our flexible travel policy, but fare difference may apply. If the new flight you're selecting is more than the originally purchased flight the difference in fare will apply and can be paid using a valid credit card.

**How can I cancel online?**

You can cancel your travel by visiting the "My Trips" section of the website. Enter the passengers last name and confirmation code. If your travel is prior to 4/30/2020, the cancellation fee will be waived, and you will receive a Frontier Travel credit valid for 90 days from the date of cancellation.

**Can we extend the travel credit beyond 90 days?**

Credits can not be extended however you don't have to travel within 90 days, travel must be reserved within 90 days. You can book travel as far out as the schedule allows which is currently November 9, 2020.

**Can the credit only be used toward a future flight of the person that booked? Or, can the Credit be used toward anyone?**

Credits are non-transferable and may only be redeemed in the name of the passenger to whom it was issued. One or more of the passengers on the original reservation must be on the new booking the credit is being applied to.

**For people who have booked with miles, how do they get a credit?**

Any changes to qualifying award tickets can be submitted via our webform [here ](https://flyfrontier.custhelp.com/app/frontierairlines)and select "COVID-19 Cancel" in the drop down.
