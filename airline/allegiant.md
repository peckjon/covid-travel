Travel Advisory: More Info
==========================

The influx of new, daily developments in the news regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has brought many concerns and an environment of uncertainty. Here at Allegiant, the health and safety of you and our team members remains the top priority in everything we do. During this period of uncertainty, be assured you can fly with confidence.  This page is intended to be a resource for the most up-to-date information affecting your travel plans.  Thank you for being an Allegiant customer.

Continuous monitoring, constant contact with health and safety agencies:

Allegiant is a domestic carrier serving only U.S. cities. All of our flights are nonstop, and our customers are primarily leisure travelers who are flying from their hometowns to vacation destinations. Allegiant does not have codeshare agreements with carriers which provide international service. We are in constant contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)), U.S. Department of Homeland Security / TSA and the U.S. Department of Transportation, and they have made no recommendations for domestic airlines to alter service at this time.

Change and cancellation policies:

We understand the decision to travel is personal and many factors are involved. To help, we've made it easier for you to change or cancel itineraries with no penalties. Changes and cancellations can now be made directly by visiting [Manage Travel](https://www.allegiantair.com/my-trips)

For cancellations, a voucher for the full amount of the current itinerary will be issued for future travel on Allegiant.  Vouchers must be used to purchase and complete travel within one year of the original booking date.

The current travel situation is causing uncertainty, and travelers have many questions. Please be aware this may cause wait times to be high on all channels but rest assured, the change/cancellation policy currently in place will be honored as long as your request is made prior to your flight departure time.  We appreciate your patience.

Aircraft cleaning and on-board atmosphere:

On board our aircraft, our teams ensure the highest standards of disinfectant cleaning and protections. Our aircraft cleaning program meets or exceeds recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO). We ensure all touch surfaces, from seat belts and tray tables to galleys and lavatories, are cleaned thoroughly and disinfected to the highest possible standard.

The air on board our all-Airbus fleet of aircraft is a mix of fresh air and air filtered through VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) filters, which offer all of the benefits of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate) filters, plus additional capabilities to filter organic compounds. Per Airbus, the air in the cabin is changed every three minutes on average during cruise. According to the CDC, most viruses and other germs are not easily spread on airplanes due to the air circulation and [filtration process.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html)
